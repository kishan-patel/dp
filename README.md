## Overview

The aim of this application is to display the results of executing multi-armed bandit algorithms in website optimization. There are two ways in which graphs representing the data set can be generated. The first method allows the user to upload a file containing the result set. The second way is to establish a connection with a source which sends data -- in this option, the graphs are updated in real time.
