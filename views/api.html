<h3>Overview</h3>

The sections below describe how you can send data to the MAB dashboard so that the 
results will be visible on a graph.


<h3>Sender</h3>
<h4>Sending a JSON object through a POST request</h4>

Each sender is uniquely identified by an id. Thus, prior to sending data, 
the sender must acquire an id from <a href="/get-id">here</a>. Once the id is received,
the JSON object (the format is show below) can be submitted to: http://dp-kpatel.rhcloud.com/send. 
The example show below uses the curl command to send the JSON object (which is stored in the file) to 
the HTTP enpoint mentioned previously.

  <div class="panel-body">
    curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @data.json http://dp-kpatel.rhcloud.com/send
  </div>
</div>


<h3>Viewer</h3> 
<h4>Viewing the sent data</h4> 

As a viewer, in order to view the data associated with a particular sender, you need to enter the sender id <a href="/live">here</a>. 
Once this action is completed, the graph will update automatically each time data comes in from this sender.



<h3>Data format</h3>  
The format of the data accepted from the sender is described below.<br/>
